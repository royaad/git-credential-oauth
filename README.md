# Git Credential OAuth

Welcome to the `git-credential-oauth` repository!

## Overview

This repository is a mock repository that is designed to initiate the OAuth process for the first time on a Linux operating system.

Please note that since this is a mock repository, it does not perform actual OAuth operations.

## What is OAuth?

OAuth (Open Authorization) is an open standard for token-based authentication and authorization on the Internet. OAuth allows an end user's account information to be used by third-party services, such as Facebook, without exposing the user's password.

## Reference

This repository uses the [git-credential-oauth](https://github.com/hickford/git-credential-oauth) repository to simulate the OAuth process.
